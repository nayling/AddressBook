Address Book Coding Challenge 2/17/9 - 2/19/19
Author: Natalie Ayling

To run:
1. Run Elasticsearch on Local Host 9200 (default for Elasticsearch)
2. Run project from editor

Description: This program is a RESTful API that uses Java Spark to handle HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to perform CRUD 
operations on a local Elasticsearch data store containing Address Book Contacts. Regular expressions and length requirements are
used to ensure legitimacy of data fields before a Contact is posted, and JUnit testing is used to test that business logic and ensure 
that the Java program behaves as expected.
